## demo points
- runs-on
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  Configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner. This means that the job will execute on a fresh virtual machine hosted by GitHub. For syntax examples using other runners, see [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on)
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
- a matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code in multiple versions of a language or on multiple operating systems. The matrix is created using the strategy keyword, which receives the build options as an array. For example, this matrix will run the job multiple times, using different versions of Node.js:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```
