## demo points
GitHub Actions are packaged scripts to automate tasks in a software-development workflow in GitHub.

### Types of GitHub actions
There are three types of GitHub actions: container actions, JavaScript actions, and composite actions.
With container actions, the environment is part of the action's code. These actions can only be run in a Linux environment that GitHub hosts. Container actions support many different languages.
JavaScript actions don't include the environment in the code. You'll have to specify the environment to execute these actions. You can run these actions in a VM in the cloud or on-premises. JavaScript actions support Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
Composite actions allow you to combine multiple workflow steps within one action. For example, you can use this feature to bundle together multiple run commands into an action, and then have a workflow that executes the bundled commands as a single step using that action.

### What is a GitHub Actions workflow?
A GitHub Actions workflow is a process that you set up in your repository to automate software-development lifecycle tasks, including GitHub Actions. With a workflow, you can build, test, package, release, and deploy any project on GitHub.
To create a workflow, you add actions to a .yml file in the _.github/workflows_ directory in your GitHub repository.

### The components of GitHub Actions

##### Workflows
A workflow is an automated process that you add to your repository. A workflow needs to have at least one job, and different events can trigger it. You can use it to build, test, package, release, or deploy your repository's project on GitHub.

##### Jobs
The job is the first major component within the workflow. A job is a section of the workflow that will be associated with a runner. A runner can be GitHub-hosted or self-hosted, and the job can run on a machine or in a container. You'll specify the runner with the runs-on: attribute. Here, you're telling the workflow to run this job on ubuntu-latest. We'll talk more about runners in the next unit.

##### Steps
A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job. In our preceding example, the step uses the action actions/checkout@v2 to check out the repository. What's interesting is the uses: ./action-a value. This is the path to the container action that you'll build in an action.yml file.

##### Actions
The actions inside your workflow are the standalone commands that are executed. These standalone commands can reference GitHub actions such as using your own custom actions, or community actions like the one we use in the preceding example, actions/checkout@v2. You can also run commands such as run: npm install -g bats to execute a command on the runner.

### Using a matrix

A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code in multiple versions of a language or on multiple operating systems. The matrix is created using the strategy keyword, which receives the build options as an array. For example, this matrix will run the job multiple times, using different versions of Node.js:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```
