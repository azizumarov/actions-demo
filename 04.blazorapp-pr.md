### Types of GitHub actions
There are three types of GitHub actions: container actions, JavaScript actions, and composite actions.
With container actions, the environment is part of the action's code. These actions can only be run in a Linux environment that GitHub hosts. Container actions support many different languages.
JavaScript actions don't include the environment in the code. You'll have to specify the environment to execute these actions. You can run these actions in a VM in the cloud or on-premises. JavaScript actions support Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
Composite actions allow you to combine multiple workflow steps within one action. For example, you can use this feature to bundle together multiple run commands into an action, and then have a workflow that executes the bundled commands as a single step using that action.
